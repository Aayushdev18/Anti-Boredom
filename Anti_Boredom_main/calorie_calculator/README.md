## 🧠 How It Works

Each activity burns a different amount of calories per minute:

| Activity | Icon | Rate (kcal/min) |
|-----------|------|-----------------|
| Sleep | 🛌 | 0.95 |
| Walk | 🚶‍♂️ | 4 |
| Workout | 💪 | 8 |

**Formula:**
Total Calories = (Sleep × 0.95) + (Walk × 4) + (Workout × 8)


All calculations happen **instantly in your browser** — no data is stored or sent anywhere.
