I understand you'd like to get the game running right away, but unfortunately, I cannot provide a real API key.

A Google Maps API key is a personal credential, like a password, linked directly to an individual's Google account and billing information. Sharing it would be a major security risk.

However, I can guide you through the process of getting your own free key. Google provides a generous free tier that is more than enough for playing this game.

How to Get Your Free API Key
Go to Google Cloud Console: Visit https://console.cloud.google.com/. You'll need to sign in with a Google account.

Create a Project: If you don't have one already, create a new project. Give it a name like "My Game Project".

Enable the APIs: You need to enable two services for this game to work:

Maps JavaScript API

Geometry Library Use the search bar at the top to find and enable both.

Set Up Billing: Google requires a billing account to be linked to your project to prevent misuse, even for free services. You will not be charged unless you manually upgrade your account or exceed the very high limits of the free tier.

Create Credentials:

Navigate to the "Credentials" page (you can search for it).

Click "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" and select "API key".

A new key will be generated for you.

Copy and Paste: Copy your new API key and paste it directly into the code.

To make this final step as easy as possible, I've updated the code with an extremely clear placeholder. Just replace the placeholder text with your new key.
